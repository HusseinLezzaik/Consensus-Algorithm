# Consensus Algorithm

## Introduction
Consensus is an important problem in cooperative control, where several agents have to be synchronized to a common value. In the case of multi-robots systems, it can be interesting for the robots to achieve a consensus on positions, like a rendez-vous point , to reach an objective at the same instant. After studying the concepts of Systems of Systems in the course of "Automatic Robotic Systems", we’ve choosen to implement the ” Rendez-Vous with target case”, where we assume the case of five robots with which we can directly control their speeds.

The purpose of our project is to propose a consensus-based control law that lets the agents meet in the specified location (0,0), study the behavior of our system and simplify our graphical model.
